                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <div class="box"><p>My name is Kaliroi Halkias and this is my final project for my Web Design class.</p> <p>I was tasked to create a responsive website that showcases interesting places in New York.<br>Unfortunately, I was not able to get into contact with the class to get links for their projects to be included here.</p> <p>(I am having a tough semester due to reasons I can't really get into.)</p> <p>Anyway... </p> <p>I used my midterm website as one link and then I created an additional website I could link.<br>To create that additional website, I had to find images that I could use for noncommercial purposes, and that was quite hard to do.</p> <p>It was also quite time consuming to make new websites to link to. So I am using existing online websites of seaside or beachside locations for the remaining two spots.</p> <p>I was planning a lot for this final but I did not have enough time to make it exactly the way I want. A bunch of things are lacking in my opinion, so will continue to improve on these sometime in the future. I will also try to add more media queries and fix up my code.</p> <p>Thank you for visiting and reading my note!</p> <p>Best,<br><br>Kaliroi Halkias</p></div>
